# Workers are created as daemon threads. This is done to allow the interpreter
# to exit when there are still idle threads in a ThreadPoolExecutor's thread
# pool (i.e. shutdown() was not called). However, allowing workers to die with
# the interpreter has two undesirable properties:
#   - The workers would still be running during interpreter shutdown,
#     meaning that they would fail in unpredictable ways.
#   - The workers could be killed while evaluating a work item, which could
#     be bad if the callable being evaluated has external side-effects e.g.
#     writing to a file.
#
# To work around this problem, an exit handler is installed which tells the
# workers to exit when their work queues are empty and then waits until the
# threads finish.

                    A bug may cause potential risk here.

                    Simply put, cause unrigister queue listening (adjust free thread count -= 1) is not atomic operation after 
                    exception thrown, thus there's slightly chance thread swtiching (which is controled by os and not going to be 
                    interfered by user) happens just right the time after listening stopped but before free thread count is adjusted.

                    At that precisely time point , if there's a new task going to be added in main thread , determine statement  
                    in ThreadPoolExecutor._adjust_thread_count would consider mistakenly there's still enough worker listening ,
                    and decide not to generate a new thread. That may eventually cause a final result of task added in queue
                    but no worker takes it out in the meantime. The last task will never run if there's no new tasks trigger ThreadPoolExecutor._adjust_thread_count afterwards.

                    To fix this problem , the most reasonable , yes high cost , solution would be hacking into cpython's queue 
                    module (which was a .pyd file projected to 'Modules/_queuemodule.c' in source code) , makes 
                    self._executor._free_thread_count adjusted before listening suspended in interrupt of timeout's callback 
                    functions.

                    If that sounds a little bit hard to implement , the alternatively simplified approach would be preserving 
                    serveral 'core thread' which would still looping in timeout but never halt , with the same quantity as 
                    ThreadPoolExecutor.min_workers.

                    Based on this implementation , the status refresh not in time bug will still occur whereas there's always 
                    sub-threads working to trigger task out of task queue. This may cause sub-threads block , which was slightly
                    out of line with expectations, at some paticular situation if existing threads occasionally full loaded.
                    With another potential symptom is , depends on which task was last triggered by system, size of thread 
                    pool may not be precisely the same as expect just right after thread shrink happened.
